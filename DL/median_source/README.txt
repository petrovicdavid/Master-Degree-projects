In order to run the median algorithm:

put the source code in a folder where there are also the subfolder (one for each specie)
of the original gray scale images.

Modify these subfolders in order to substitute the space (" ") with a "-".
ex: from "G. BulloidesG" to "G-Bulloides".

OUTPUT: the output will be in a subfolder named "medianIMG"
