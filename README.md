## Overview
Repository that contains all the projects of MSc in Computer Engineering
## Courses:
### AI - Artificial Intelligence
The assignment was to explore the applications and benefits of AI with social impact, reading papers regarding a specific topic and then formulate a unique solution combining them.

Our case study was about the monitoring of aquatic toxicity.

### BDC - Big Data Computing
There were three homeworks to do during the course using Apache Spark:
1. Counting all distincts triangles in a network, approximating the number in two ways.
2. Counting all distincts triangles in a large network using a cluster, given as output na approximated number and the exact number.
3. Estimate the individual frequencies of the items provided by an input stream, using Apache Spark Streaming API and count sketch algotithm.

### CV - Computer Vision
The objective of this project is to create a computer vision system with the capability to scan a cantees consumer's food tray after a meal and estimate the amount of leftovers for each type of food.

### DL - Deep Learning
The assignment was to find a new way to convert 16 grayscale images in one RGB image, for a later CNN training. The test was done using the pre-trained Alexnet from Matlab and Pytorch, subsequently comparing the performances.

### IR - Intelligent Robotics
The assignment was to create a robot navigation system, using TIAGo, that performs a pick and place task between two rooms, detecting the objects on the table to pick and the position of the tables to place the objects.

### ML - Machine Learning
Three individual projects and various laboratories regarding ML course.
